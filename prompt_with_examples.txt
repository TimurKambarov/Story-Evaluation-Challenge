1. Relevance. The story resonates with society and is tied to sociability. A story affects personal lives of people. (Examples: "1984" by George Orwell, "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, "The Diary of a Young Girl" by Anne Frank)

2. Coherence. The story makes sense. The story has sentence to sentence flow, overall narrative consistency. The story has clear cause-and-effect relationship and absence of contradictions. (Examples: "This Is Water" by David Foster Wallace, "Thinking In Systems" by Donella H. Meadows, "The Big Picture" by Sean Carroll)

3. Empathy. The characters' emotions are clearly conveyed. The story provides emotional context. (Examples: "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou, "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" by John Boyne, "No Longer at Ease" by Chinua Achebe)

4. Surprise. The ending of the story is unpredictable. The story balances predictability and novelty. (Examples: "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides, "Verity" by Colleen Hoover, "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens)

5. Engagement. The story is able to hold attention. (Examples: "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone" by J.K. Rowling, "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins)
